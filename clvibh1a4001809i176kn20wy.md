### Introduction

A **Bash Script** is a text file with several commands written in the Bash shell language. The Bash shell carries out operations one by one when you run the script. This allows you to automate repetitive tasks, manage files, and configure systems. On Linux and macOS, two Unix-like operating systems, bash scripts simplify and expedite tasks.

**Ansible** is an open-source automation tool for configuration and management of IT infrastructures. It allows for the easy management of numerous servers using YAML language to describe automated tasks. Ansible operates agentlessly, meaning there is no need to install additional software on the nodes it manages.

---

You will appreciate the use of Ansible as a tool if you find out about things it does to make your IT job easy. Here are some advantages:

* Ease of use and simplicity: YAML is a human-readable language used to write playbooks (configuration files).
    
* Strong and adaptable: Ansible is capable of managing challenging jobs and changing with the times.
    
* Agentless: Management and security are made simpler by not requiring software to be installed on the controlled nodes.
    
* Idempotent: Playbooks can be run repeatedly without producing unpleasant or unexpected results.
    
* Huge support and community: Ansible has a large and active community, as well as a wealth of modules and resources.
    

### Context

Just so we understand what we are going to be doing in this project, I will explain all that it entails:

* We are going to automate the provisioning of two Ubuntu-based servers, named “master” and “slave”, using Vagrant.
    
* On the Master node, we will create a bash script to automate the deployment of a LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) stack.
    
* The bash script we create above should clone a PHP application from [GitHub](https://github.com/laravel/laravel), install all necessary packages, and configure Apache web server and MySQL.
    
* We will ensure the bash script is reusable and readable.
    
* Using Ansible Playbook, we will execute the bash script on the Slave node and verify that the PHP application is accessible through the Virtual Machine’s IP address.
    
* We will also create a cron job to check the server’s uptime every 12 am.
    

## Steps

### Setting Up Virtual Machines

* To create a Virtual Machine, Check these resources for [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/how-to-run-ubuntu-desktop-on-a-virtual-machine-using-virtualbox#1-overview).
    
* You should have a Vagrantfile for the Virtual Machines saved in your local file folder just like mine below after you start your machine. But if you don't I can walk you through it. Remember you need to create 2 Ubuntu servers named "master" and "slave". Open your Virtual box down as you will need it open to start your Virtual Machines. Create two folders and name them "master" and "slave".
    

![folders](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/rkxmjnhwvvao9v7wq8ap.png align="center")

* Open the folders with Gitbash. Let us start with the "master" folder.
    

![gitbash](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/0tqcrc4j5liiwrg03m8a.png align="center")

* Next is to Initialize your master Ubuntu machine. After opening the "master" folder with git bash, run:
    

```plaintext
vagrant init Ubuntu/focal64
```

![vagrant init master](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/19r7n91tj69yvikga1iz.png align="center")

* Open the `Vagrantfile` and make some edits to the configuration file using the command `nano vagrantfile`. It would help if you had something like this.
    

![vagrantfile](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/yfor67itsif16ys07y9v.png align="center")

* Go ahead to paste the configuration below just under `Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|` like the image below. Also, add `config.ssh.insert_key = false` under `config.vm.box = ubuntu/focal64`. Press "crtl+O" to save, then "enter" and "ctrl+x" to exit the vagrantfile.
    

```plaintext
# Provision master Node
config.vm.define "master" do |master|
master.vm.box = "ubuntu/focal64"
master.vm.hostname = "master"
master.vm.network "private_network", ip: "192.168.33.10", type: "dhcp"
end
```

NOTE: I have circled the aspects you paste the various commands under. Pay attention to them.

![vagrantfile](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/tw2jry0v1pw6xzvux13o.png align="center")

Then run the following command to start the machine. It would be best if you had something like the image below towards the end after running the command.

```plaintext
vagrant up
```

![vagrant up master](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/rob6te8xu2l6649o5d0t.png align="center")

* Connect the virtual machine by running:
    

```plaintext
vagrant ssh
```

![vagrant ssh](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/cch48p1ullz2xc80r16k.png align="center")

* Now that you have logged into your "masters" virtual machine, follow the same procedure for the "slave" virtual machine. You should have something like the screenshot below by the time you ssh into your "slave" virtual machine.
    

![slave machine](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/qgy620qc9b38l2xcxfao.png align="center")

NOTE: Every other thing is the same for the procedure except for the configuration in the vagrant file which should be under `Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|`. Use the command below under the `Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|`.

```plaintext
# Provision Slave Node
config.vm.define "slave" do |slave|
slave.vm.box = "ubuntu/focal64"
slave.vm.hostname = "slave"
slave.vm.network "private_network", ip: "192.168.33.11", type: "dhcp"
end
```

### Connect the "master" and "slave" machines by \_ssh-ing \_into each of them

* Use the command `ip a` to check for the IP address of each of the virtual machines. Below is that of the "master's" virtual machine. The circled one is the IP address for the "master" virtual machine. Do the same for the "slave" virtual machine. I have underlined each one for you to know what virtual machine owns each IP address. Also, note that your IP address will be different from mine.
    

![IP address for master](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/fmvqj5sl1nlq1p6uqpne.png align="center")

![IP address for slave](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/gpz6zl0hlqhqlaj8ilyf.png align="left")

* On your "master" Virtual Machine, write `ssh-keygen` to generate a private & public key. When you run the command you will see `Enter file in which to save the key (/home/vagrant/.ssh/id_rsa): Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): Enter same passphrase again:` Keep pressing the "enter" key when those 3 lines appear as seen below.
    

![master key](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/1sy4xf095bedmeiu0i6l.png align="center")

* We will repeat the above step for the "slave" virtual machine too and should look like what is below.
    

![slave key](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/bsdu0x6jghqwpri6b4e1.png align="center")

* In the "master" virtual machine, change the directory into ssh with the command `cd .ssh` then `ls` to list all the files in the ssh directory. You will see something like what is below.
    

![cd .ssh](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/azsemm3tqm0kriyh3jhg.png align="center")

* Open the content of  id\_rsa.pub and copy it to save it somewhere for later use. That is where your public key is and that is what you are copying. Use this command to open it `cat id_rsa.pub`. The key would be long and look like something below.
    

![public key](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/zga3e9pjjvv8wx1vbyo0.png align="center")

* Change the directory to .ssh with the command `cd .ssh` just as we did in the "master" virtual machine. Create and open a file in the `.ssh` directory of the "slave" machine at once so that the public key you copied from the "masters" machine and saved somewhere, you will paste it in the created file. I named my file 'public'. Run the command `nano public` and paste the public key from the "master" virtual machine here. After pasting all the public keys correctly, press 'crtl+O' to save, press 'enter', and then press 'ctrl+X' to exit.
    
* Then run the command `cat public >> authorized_keys` to copy the public keys into the authorized\_keys file from the file named public in the "slave" machine. Run the command `cat authorized_keys` to see the content of the copied public keys of the "masters" virtual machine and the "slave" virtual machine. Below is an image of both the "masters" and "slave" public keys.
    

![public keys](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/1k2xwo345aagpgn040yn.png align="center")

* Connect the "master" virtual machine to the "slave" virtual machine by using ssh to connect the IP address of the "slave" machine to the "master" machine. First of all, run the command `ip a` to know the IP addresses in each machine. Then run the command ssh vagrant@slave ip in the "master" virtual machine. It should look like this `ssh vagrant@192.168.33.9` Make sure to replace the IP address with your own "slave" IP address. Whatever it prompts you, type 'yes'. From the screenshot, you can see that we can connect to our "slave" machine from the "master" machine.

### Creating the Bash Script to automate the provisioning of the two Ubuntu-based Virtual Machines we've created.

* In your "master" virtual machine, create your script that will automate the deployment of LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) stack.
    
* Name your script anything of your choice with the .sh extension. I will be naming mine LAMP.sh. Use the command `touch LAMP.sh` to create your script. run `ls` to see if the script file you ran is showing.
    

![create script](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/e8ybz9t94pauwzz8h2vy.png align="center")

* Run `nano LAMP.sh` to open the file script and write your script. Please copy and paste this script inside it. Each line of the command has a comment with a brief explanation with a '#' symbol in front of it. I made sure to pick each line of commands one by one to run before compiling it into a full script below.

---

* Still in your "master" machine create an Ansible directory with the command
    

```plaintext
mkdir Ansible
```

* Change into the `Ansible` directory so it becomes your present working directory.
    

```plaintext
cd Ansible
```

* Run this command to update any dependencies. From the image below, you should have something like the image below at the end after the update.
    

```plaintext
sudo apt-get update
```

![apt-get update](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/nnkifk05rvmbwkg2r6ga.png align="center")

* Then to install Ansible run the command below. It would be best if you had something like the image at the end of the installation.
    

```plaintext
sudo apt install ansible
```

![install ansibe](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/a4wbnt6dkvdyuwjkmqjv.png align="center")

---

* Still, in your `Ansible` directory, create your inventory. The inventory file is used to store the address of the slave nodes to be configured which will enable the playbook to run in the "slave" machine even if it is created in the "master's" machine.
    

```plaintext
touch inventory
```

* Open your inventory file to put in the IP address of your "slave" machine. It should look like the image below, but use your IP address. Press 'crtl+O' to save, press 'enter', and then 'crtl+X' to exit the text editor.
    

![IP address](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/jk303ss3mq1xca0ld0d9.png align="center")

---

* Create your playbook with the `.yml` extension.
    

```plaintext
touch playbook.yml
```

To ping your inventory run the command in your "master" machine. It should look like the screenshot below. Press 'crtl+C' to cancel it afterwards.

```plaintext
ansible all -m ping -i inventory
```

![pinging](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/h1phsxozii0eg0d78559.png align="center")

* Change the directory back to Ansible with the command `cd Ansible`. Then open the playbook with the command `nano playbook.yml`. Paste the command below inside your playbook but change the IP address to your "slave" machine IP. Press 'crtl+O' to save, press 'enter', and then 'crtl+X' to exit the playbook.
    

```yaml

* Run the command below to execute the playbook:
    

```plaintext
ansible-playbook playbook.yml -i inventory
```

* I could execute the bash script on the Slave node and verify that the PHP application is accessible through the VM’s IP address. I have circled the slave IP address in the screenshot.

### Conclusion

In summary, one of the effective and dependable methods for provisioning and controlling servers has been demonstrated in this project by the automation of the LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) stack deployment utilizing Bash script in Ansible. The deployment of the LAMP stack on Ubuntu-based servers is quite fast and less labor-intensive than with manual setup because of the script automation and it is even reusable.

The Bash script can be easily adapted to many environments and use cases due to its reusability, which is attained through defining variables that can be passed as parameters and error handling.

The deployment process was further automated and made uniform and repeatable by integrating the script into an Ansible playbook. In addition to establishing cron jobs to track server uptime and confirming that PHP applications could be accessed, the playbook carried out actions on both the master and slave nodes, giving important information about server performance.

Even though there were a few difficulties along the road, like script errors and log file problems, these could be fixed with thorough debugging and code modifications. The result showed that the PHP application had been deployed and verified successfully on the slave node's IP address.

All things considered, the project demonstrates how Ansible and Bash scripting can be used to automate intricate deployment procedures. This detailed documentation of the stages and solutions makes it a useful tool for future deployments and projects utilizing the LAMP stack.
