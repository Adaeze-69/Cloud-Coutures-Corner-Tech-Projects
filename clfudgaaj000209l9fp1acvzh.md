Met me before? I doubt. If you have met me before, act like you haven't so this introduction seem official. 😎

Adaeze Nnamdi-Udekwe is my name and I am an AWS Solutions Architect and Azure Cloud Practitioner. As at when I wrote this, 8 months has gone by into pivoting to tech from an Agricultural background. I am a graduate of Niger Delta University,Bayelsa State, Nigeria. I am working on a couple of cloud projects which I will also be sharing with you as time goes on.

I am really excited to be sharing my cloud computing journey,experience and tips with you. They are usually very useful,trust me. 👩‍💻

I can be goofy at times, so expect some humor sandwiched in my article. I really wish you enjoy your stay with me here as much as I will enjoy reading your feedbacks, questions, and comments. 😉

Enjoy reading from me! 🤗
